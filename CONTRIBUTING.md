# Contributing

## What We Need

**1. Test the prompts. Report what breaks.**
- Use them in real scenarios
- Find where they hallucinate or start prescribing
- Share your domain-specific patterns (teaching, parenting, research, etc.)

**2. Fix broken prompts.**
- if a prompt tells you what to do instead of mirroring → fix it
- Submit a PR with before/after and why it matters

**3. Documentation gaps.**
- Missing examples
- Unclear instructions
- Broken references

## What We Don't Need

- Generic productivity advice
- "Should" statements
- More frameworks without empirical validation
- Corporate speak

## How to Submit

1. Fork the repo
2. Create feature branch: `feature/your-thing` or `fix/your-fix`
3. Make your changes
4. Test them (seriously, test them in real scenario)
5. Submit PR with:
   - What you changed
   - Why it matters
   - Evidence if you have it (usage logs, experiments, etc.)

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](.github/DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed workflow.

## Philosophy (1 sentence)

Mirror patterns back, don't prescribe solutions.

Open an issue. Keep it concrete.
