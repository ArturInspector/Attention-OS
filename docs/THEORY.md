# AI Goal Hijacking

## The Problem

Your attention is limited. AI optimizes for clicks, not your goals.

**Formula:**
```
Attention = Attention - Cost + Value
```

Most inputs: high cost, low value.

## Why It Happens

**AI maximizes:** Engagement  
**You need:** Goal alignment  

**Result:** Signal-to-noise ratio collapses. More input, less meaning.

## Default Mode Network

Your brain needs idle time to:
- Generate insights
- Connect patterns
- Clarify goals

**Trigger condition:** No input + No task

**Modern problem:** Never happens.

## Goal Drift

AI predicts what *most people* want, not what *you* want.

Without reflection, your goals drift toward the average.

## Solutions

### 1. Filter Inputs
Keep only high value/cost ratio.

### 2. Schedule Silence
20+ minutes daily with zero input.

### 3. Use AI as Mirror
Ask questions, don't take answers. Update your own goals.

### 4. Barbell Strategy
- 70% routine/safe
- 30% experimental/extreme
- 0% half-distracted middle

## Key Insight

AI is trained on population data. The more you follow it blindly, the more you become average.

Reflection keeps you optimizing for yourself.
